Count data normalization

\description{
Normalize count data to remove systematic technical effects.
}

\usage{
normalizeCounts(counts, group=rep.int(1,ncol(counts)), method=c("TMM", "cqn"),
                common.disp = FALSE, prior.n=1, annot=NULL, lib.sizes=NULL, verbose=TRUE)
}

\arguments{
  \item{counts}{
    numeric data.frame or matrix containing the count data.
  }
  \item{group}{
    vector giving the experimental group/condition for each
    sample/library. This argument is only relevant
    when \code{method="TMM"}.
  }
  \item{method}{
    specific method to use in order to normalize the input matrix of counts. By default
    this is set to TMM (Robinson and Oshlack, 2010) using the implementation available
    in the edgeR package. The other option is cqn (Hansen, Irizarry and Wu, 2012).
  }
  \item{common.disp}{
    logical indicating whether a common or tagwise (default) dispersions
    should be estimated and employed when adjusting counts. This argument is only relevant
    when \code{method="TMM"}.
  }
  \item{prior.n}{
    argument provided to the call of \code{\link[edgeR]{estimateTagwiseDisp}}
    which defines the amount of shrinkage of the estimated tagwise
    dispersions to the common one. By default \code{prior.n=1} thus
    assumming no shrinkage toward that common dispersion. This
    argument is not used if \code{common.disp=TRUE}. This argument is only relevant
    when \code{method="TMM"}.
  }
  \item{annot}{
    matrix or data frame with row names matching at least part of the row names in the
    \code{counts} input matrix, containing feature/tag/gene lengths in bp on its first column,
    and a second covariate, such as G+C content, on its second column. These two pieces
    of information are provided to arguments \code{lengths} and \code{x} when calling
    \code{\link[cqn]{cqn}}. This argument is only relevant when \code{method="TMM"}.
  }
  \item{lib.sizes}{
    vector of the total number of reads to be considered per sample/library. If
    \code{lib.sizes=NULL} (default) then these quantities are estimated as the column
    sums in the input matrix of counts.
  }
  \item{verbose}{
    logical indicating whether progress should be reported.
  }
}

\details{
  This function encapsulates calls to RNA-seq normalization procedures available in
  the \code{\link[edgeR]{edgeR}} and \code{\link[cqn]{cqn}} packages in order to try
  to remove systematic technical effects from raw counts.By default, the
  TMM method described in Robinson and Oshlack (2010) is employed to calculate normalization factors which are applied to
  estimate effective library sizes, then common and tagwise (only when the
  argument common.disp=TRUE) dispersions are calculated (Robinson and Smyth,
  Bioinformatics 2007) and finally counts are adjusted so that library sizes
  are approximately equal for the given dispersion values (Robinson and
  Smyth, Biostatistics 2008).Setting the argument \code{method="cqn"}, conditional
  quantile normalization (Hansen, Irizarry and Wu, 2012) is applied which aims at
  adjusting for tag/feature/gene length and other covariate such as G+C content. This
  information should be provided through the \code{annot} argument. This procedure
  calculates, for every gene and every sample, an offset to apply to the log2 reads per
  million (RPM) and the function \code{normalizeCounts()} adds this offset to the
  the log2 RPM values calculated from the input count data matrix, unlogs them and rolls
  back these normalized RPM values into integer counts. Details on these two normalization
  procedures are given in the documentation of the \code{edgeR} and \code{cqn} Bioconductor
  packages.
